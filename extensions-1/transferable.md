# Transferable

The transferable extension defines a basic two-step process to transfer a role value :

1. current role assigns a new address for the role
2. new address confirms the transfer

```ocaml
archetype extension transferable (

 variable[%transferable%] aRole role

) = {
  variable <%aRole>_tmp role

  action assign_new_<%aRole> (newrole : role) = {
    called by aRole
    effect {
      <%aRole>_tmp := newrole
    }
  }

  action confirm_<%aRole> = {
    called by <%aRole>tmp
    effect {
      aRole := <%aRole>tmp
    }
  }
}

```
