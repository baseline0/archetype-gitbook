# Voting process

This archetype defines a basic voting process. The chairman is responsible for registering voters. The use of the `mutable` extension gives the chairman the extra right to modify the voting agenda, in Created state only.

The result of the vote is computed with the `bury` action: winners are ballots with the highest number of votes.
