# Health care

This contract is adapted from the DAML 's  [introductory insurance contract](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/introduction.html).

DAML is a distributed private ledger and does not enforce payments; the contract just generates bills of insurer and patient, for accounting purposes. 

The strength of a public blockchain with a crypto money, is that it allows payments and accounting of payments in a _single business process_. The main differences between the contract below and the DAML version are:

* payments are executed through contract entries
* the contract enters the _Running_ state with validation from both insurer and patient parties

The main benefit of this version is that it may serve as an opposable document in the case of a default in payment: indeed, since the contract is used to channel payments, the contract is accounting for any default of payment \(in the _debts_ variables\).

For example, a doctor may go to court and exhibit the _debt_ value of his corresponding doctor asset as a proof of the default in payment.

From a design point of vue, the contract manages several doctors. A doctor is registered with approvals from both patient and insurer parties.

{% hint style="info" %}
We see in this basic example, that a smart contract on a public blockchain with a crypto money, enables organisations to capture the critical aspects of a business process : payments, permissions and accounting.
