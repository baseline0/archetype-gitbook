description: Transfer decision relies on oracle data

# With oracle decision

The escrow with penalty contract is not totally satisfactory because the decision to transfer or cancel is left to the oracle, which is not really the role of an oracle. The oracle is more likely to generate information in pojo-like format. The decision procedure is left to the contract.

In this version, the oracle says whether a task has been completed or not, in the form of a pojo with two informations:

1. a date
2. a status \(`OK` or `KO`\)

The decision rule is the following: if the date is before the deadline and if the status is “OK” then the transfer occurs, otherwise it is cancelled.

The oracle provides with a description of the pojo in the [JSON SCHEMA](https://json-schema.org/) format:

```yaml
{
  "$id": "https://oracle.com/task_status.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "TaskStatus",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [ "date", “status” ],
  "properties": {
    "date": {
      "type": "date",
      "description": "Date of the task status."
    },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["OK", "KO"],
      "description": "Task status."
    }
  }
}
```

The code below illustrates the use of the above schema with the object keyword:
