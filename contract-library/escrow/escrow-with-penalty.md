# Escrow with penalty

The escrow archetype presented below defines an escrow process with a penalty for the seller if the transaction fails \(for example if it does not happen before the deadline\).

Factoring is enabled: the seller can sell the “invoice” to a creditor, and the buyer can sell the penalty to a debtor.

A state machine is used to follow the different stages of the escrow transaction.
