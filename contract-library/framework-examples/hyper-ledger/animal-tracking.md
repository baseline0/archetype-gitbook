# Animal tracking

> This is an Animal Tracking Business Network based on UK DEFRA government regulations \([https://www.gov.uk/animal-movement-england](https://www.gov.uk/animal-movement-england)\). Farmers can move animals between farms/fields and the UK government farming regulator has visibility into the locations of all animals and all animal movements between farms.
>
> This business network defines:
>
> **Participants** `Farmer` `Regulator`
>
> **Assets** `Animal` `Business` `Field`
>
> **Transactions** `AnimalMovementDeparture` `AnimalMovementArrival` `SetupDemo`
>
> Each Farmer owns a Business that is identified by a Single Business Identifier \(SBI\). A Farmer owns a set of Animals. A Business owns a set of Fields. A Field contains a set of Animals owned by the Farmer. Animals can be transferred between Farmers or between Fields.
