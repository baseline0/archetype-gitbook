# Vehicle life cycle

> This network tracks the Lifecycle of Vehicles from manufacture to being scrapped involving private owners, manufacturers and scrap merchants. A regulator is able to provide oversight throughout this whole process.
>
> This business network defines:
>
> **Participants** `AuctionHouse` `Company` `Manufacturer` `PrivateOwner` `Regulator` `ScrapMerchant`
>
> **Assets** `Order` `Vehicle`
>
> **Transactions** `PlaceOrder` `UpdateOrderStatus` `ApplicationForVehicleRegistrationCertificate` `PrivateVehicleTransfer` `ScrapVehicle` `UpdateSuspiciousScrapAllVehiclesByColour` `SetupDemo`
>
> **Events** `PlaceOrderEvent` `UpdateOrderStatusEvent` `ScrapVehicleEvent`
>
> A `PriavteOwner` participant would submit a `PlaceOrder` transaction, through a Manufacturer's application. A `Manufacturer` would submit an `UpdateOrderStatus` transaction which would be the Vehicle being manufactured. They would apply for a registration certificate by submitting an `ApplicationForVehicleRegistrationCertificate` transaction. After the vehicle has been manufactured they would submit a `PrivateVehicleTransfer` transaction. A `Regulator` would be able perform oversight over this whole process and submit an `UpdateSuspicious` transaction to view any suspicious vehicles that may be out of compliance with regulations. A `ScrapMerchant` would be able to submit a `ScrapVehicle` or a `ScrapAllVehiclesByColour` transaction to complete the lifecycle of a vehicle.
