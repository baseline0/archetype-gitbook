# Perishable Goods

> Example business network that shows growers, shippers and importers defining contracts for the price of perishable goods, based on temperature readings received for shipping containers.
>
> The business network defines a contract between growers and importers. The contract stipulates that: On receipt of the shipment the importer pays the grower the unit price x the number of units in the shipment. Shipments that arrive late are free. Shipments that have breached the low temperate threshold have a penalty applied proportional to the magnitude of the breach x a penalty factor. Shipments that have breached the high temperate threshold have a penalty applied proportional to the magnitude of the breach x a penalty factor.
