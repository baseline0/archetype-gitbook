# Contract specification

## Formal property

A formal property is a _logical formula_ about the relations between data values and/or asset collections properties. It is made of:

* logical connectors: and, or, implies, not
* quantifiers: the universal quantifier _forall_ and the existential quantifier _exists_
* atomic predicates, which are the relations between values and/or asset collection:
  *  between values \(integers, tez, ...\): =, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;, &gt;, ...
  * between asset collections: subset of, ...
  * between an asset and a collection: member of, ... 

For example, say you are dealing with a contract set up as a
