# Archetype language

The archetype language is a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to define smart contracts. This section presents the main features of the language.

The language provides the basic contract features to: 

* exchange currency between accounts
* define data and collection of assets
* formalise contract properties \(as state machine and/or as logical properties\)
