# Archetype language

The archetype language is a DSL to define smart contract. This section presents the main features of the language.

The language provides the basic contract features to exchange currency between accounts,  abstract data model, and more advanced features to formalise the properties the contract is supposed to have \(state machine, formal specification\).

Note that the language guarantees program terminaison by design \(it is not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)\).
