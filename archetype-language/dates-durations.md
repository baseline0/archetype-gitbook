# Dates, Durations

## Durations

A duration value may be defined with a combination of several duration units:

* day using `d`
* week using `w`
* month using `m`
* year using `y`

```text

```

Durations values may be compared with the 6 comparison operators. 

Two duration values may be added or subtracted. It is also possible to multiply a duration by an integer value.
