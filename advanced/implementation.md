Archetype is implemented in Ocaml. 

The code generation is developed as a [why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) plugin. Why3 indeed has the possibility to accept an input language as long as it is provided with a converter from this language to the why3 format.

The plugin currently consists in:

* the Archetype parser \(robust parser generated by menhir\)
* the converter to the _whyml_ parsing tree structure
* printers to
  * liquidity
  * mlw \(ie why3 format; there is no mlw printer in why3\)

The schema below illustrates the structure of the plugin:
